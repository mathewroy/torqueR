## What is torqueR?

  torqueR is a demonstration of how to visualize your own vehicle's data using R.

## Why did I create this?

  I wanted to understand what was going on with my car after it threw a check-engine light. My car was symptompatic and the diagnostic codes were related to the Mass Air Flow sensor (MAF), but this was only one plausibility. To find out more about the conditions leading to the symptoms, I logged my car's internal data for further study. The issue stemmed from a MAF that required some cleaning, and faulty replacement MAFs that I bought from a local auto parts store. While using torque wasn't directly involved in realizing that the MAF had to be cleaned, it was a great learning experience. My car's all good now.

## How does it work?

  All modern cars are equipped with on-board diagnostics systems (ODB). These ODB systems provide owners and mechanics with access to information from the car's internal computers. Since the mid-90's all new cars are equipped with the latest ODB standard, called ODB-II, which provide us with various information on the car's inner workings.
  
  Among other things, mechanics rely on information from the ODB-II system to diagnose check-engine lights and other issues. To analyze the car's data, an ODB-II scanner tool can be used to connect to the car's ODB-II port. This port is typically located below the steering column of the car. Nowadays, tools come in many forms, including Wireless ODB-II adapters which can plug-in to the ODB-II port and transmit information via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to your Android Phone or other device.

  I use a Bluetooth capable ODBII adapter to transmit information from my car. I receive this information using my Android phone and an app called Torque. The Torque app's settings are highly configurable - I have enabled logging so that any information collected are saved as time-stamped .csv files in a specific folder.

  I use a second app called DriveSync (Drive as in Google Drive/OneDrive) to automatically upload any .csv files from my Torque App's log folder to my Google Drive.

## Who will use torqueR

  These scripts are for anyone interested in playing around with their own car's data.
  
## What is the goal of this project?

  The goal of this project is to show others how they can learn more about car data with ODBII, Torque, and R. It's a great way to use data for diagnostics and performance improvement.
